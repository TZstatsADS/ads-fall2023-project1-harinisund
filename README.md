### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Project title: Cats, Dogs and (Happy) People
+ This project is conducted by Harini Sundararajan

+ Project summary: In this analysis, I am going to attempt to answer a series of questions pertaining to dogs and cats and their impact on human happiness. I'll consider them collectively as well as comparatively in this respect. I will be trying to answer a few questions: 
  + What makes animal lovers tick - _apart_ from animals?
  + Settling the debate - cats vs dogs (What sort of contributions do they make to happiness? How do general sentiments differ?)
